# Prebuilt 'scsynth' File

The `scsynth` file is an audio server provided by SuperCollider that is used for audio analysis, synthesis, and processing. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider).

MiniClef uses a prebuilt version of `scsynth` so that users do not need to install SuperCollider itself. The specific prebuilt version of `scsynth` is taken from [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi).
