# MiniClef: Sheet Music Generation for Live Coding in Python

## Albert Qi

### Fall 2024

Live coding is a dynamic form of artistic expression that allows performers to create original sounds and music in real-time through programming. While it is primarily used for performance purposes, live coding also holds potential as a valuable tool in the realm of education. For example, if I want to explain polyrhythms to students, then I want to be able to generate many different rhythms whenever necessary. Yet, despite its popularity, live coding tools are typically limited to audio generation and do not offer support for creating sheet music. Sheet music is a crucial element in music education, as it helps students learn music theory through visual representation.

To address this gap, I introduce MiniClef, a domain-specific language for live coding embedded within Python that generates accompanying sheet music based on the underlying code. I begin by presenting MiniClef through a series of examples, highlighting its key features and how it can be used to create music. Next, I explain how MiniClef generates sheet music and provide examples that demonstrate its educational potential. Finally, I discuss possible future developments that could further enhance MiniClef's functionality and expand its usefulness in music education.
